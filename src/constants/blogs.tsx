        description: `Serverless has taken cloud computing by storm. This article compares cloud FaaS platforms (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) with Ethereum smart contracts as two forms of serverless—use cloud for speed and PII handling, use smart contracts for neutrality and cross-organization coordination.`,

        description: `The main problem is the mismatch in decimal places between cryptocurrencies 
        (e.g., MATIC, USDC) and fiat currencies. Cryptocurrencies often have extremely small sub-units 
        (like wei or gwei), while fiat only has 2 decimal places. This can lead to loss of fractional value 
        when converting between these assets in smart contracts, which is a common issue developers face when 
        building DeFi applications.`,
