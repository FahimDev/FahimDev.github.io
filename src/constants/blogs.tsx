        description: `The main problem is the mismatch in decimal places between cryptocurrencies 
        (e.g., MATIC, USDC) and fiat currencies. Cryptocurrencies often have extremely small sub-units 
        (like wei or gwei), while fiat only has 2 decimal places. This can lead to loss of fractional value 
        when converting between these assets in smart contracts, which is a common issue developers face when 
        building DeFi applications.`,

        The Fabric Wallet contains critical components like a digital certificate, private key, 
        and membership ID that authenticate and authorize users in the Hyperledger Fabric network. 
        Without a Fabric Wallet, users cannot access or perform transactions on the private blockchain network.
