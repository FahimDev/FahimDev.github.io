        description: `Hotelereum is an innovative hotel booking platform that seamlessly integrates NFT (Non-Fungible Token) 
        technology into the travel and hospitality industry. It allows users to book accommodations and transform their 
        reservations into unique digital assets, represented as NFTs. These NFTs grant ownership over bookings, allowing travelers 
        not only to secure their stay but also to trade, sell, or transfer their reservations on various marketplaces.`,
