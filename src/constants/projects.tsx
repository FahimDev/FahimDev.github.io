            It is a dApp of Marketplace where people can book hotels and resell them in proprietary or 3rd party marketplaces. 
        Different hotels can join here as a partner to enable their services in Web3 networks. Reservations are identified as NFT digital objects. 
        So the reservation owner can actually own their bookings and can resell those. So refund claiming will not  an issue anymore.

When switching between these frontends, the general KYC information may not be mapped properly, as the principals will be unique.",

Consequently, the linked ledger account ID is dedicated to holding crypto balances for each dApp. Therefore, users must top up their wallets individually for trading or shopping on each dApp with their crypto funds.",
            "Dynamically creating multi-tenant vendor dApps that are automatically deployed to the ICP mainnet can present challenges. One major issue is that if a frontend canister is also dynamically deployed for each store, consumers will have to sign up for each store individually to obtain their principal address. This could lead to a poor shopping experience.",
