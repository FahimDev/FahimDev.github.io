            Hi, I’m Ariful! With a background in software engineering I’ve been contributing to both local government projects 
            and international client ventures over the past three years. I specialize in crafting robust backend architectures 
            and Web3 services. I’ve combined my backend development expertise with blockchain technologies, earning me the well-deserved 
            title of ‘Blockend’. My expertise extends to NFT marketplace microstructures, and I’ve contributed to research published in ACM, 
            IEEE Access, and ICBC. Notably, I led a Norway Government-funded research project on Blockchain-based National Health Service.
